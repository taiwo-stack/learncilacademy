## Technical Architecture & State Management

### Frontend & Styling System
- **Framework**: React 19 and React Router DOM v7 (SPA routing wrapper).
- **Design Language**: Custom styling built with native CSS custom properties (`global.css`). 
- **Typography & Aesthetics**: Utilizes premium Google Fonts (`Poppins` for headings, `Outfit` for body text) paired with dark glassmorphism effects, dynamic shadows, and glowing border gradients.
- **Icons**: SVG-based iconography sourced from `lucide-react`.

### Dual-Layer Service Layer (Mock/Production Failover)
The platform is designed to operate seamlessly with or without an active cloud database. The data layer in `dataService.js` performs a startup checks on environment configurations:

```
[Start App] ──> [Check env variables in supabaseClient.js]
                     │
                     ├──> Config Found? ──> [Production Mode] ──> Connect to Supabase
                     │                                            (Authentication & Database)
                     │
                     └──> Config Missing? ──> [Mock Mode] ──> Fallback to local storage
                                                             (Initializes Mock Data sets)
```

- **Production Mode**: Calls the `@supabase/supabase-js` client to fetch/mutate tables and manage session authentication.
- **Mock Mode**: Automatically loads pre-seeded JSON datasets (covering mock users, tutors, courses, schedules, and whiteboard pages) and persists all additions or modifications directly to the user's `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

### WebRTC & Media Calling Infrastructure
The virtual whiteboard implements a full-mesh WebRTC calling client built on top of browser media APIs:
- **Signaling Channel**: Supabase Realtime client broadcast event loops are used to transmit connection handshakes (*SDP Offers*, *SDP Answers*, and *ICE candidates*).
- **ICE Queues**: Queues ICE candidates if candidates are received before the local connection configuration description (`setRemoteDescription`) has finished parsing.
- **Media streams**: Captures camera frames (`getUserMedia`) and maps them to floating CSS grids.
- **Audio RMS analysis**: Employs an `AudioContext` and `AnalyserNode` frequency spectrum loop to determine real-time speech intensities, lighting up avatar rings when a participant speaks.

### Real-Time Workspace Sync via Supabase Channels
Collaboration on the whiteboard syncs coordinates and drawings using real-time channels:
- **Drawings Broadcast**: Mouse/Stylus movement paths are broadcasted as lightweight packets across a broadcast channel.
- **Collaborator Cursors**: Emits absolute canvas pointer positions to display moving cursor badges for all active room participants.
- **Page Syncing**: The Host transmits state updates to align the slide index and draw configurations of guest screens.

## Database Schema & Migrations

If connected to Supabase, the database structure comprises:

| Table Name | Description | Key Relationships / Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles` | User accounts with roles | Linked to auth users (`id`). Contains `role` (*student, tutor, admin*), `full_name`. |
| `students` | Detailed K-12 learner profile | Contains emergency contacts, parent details, grade level, and program type. |
| `tutors` | Tutor profile descriptions | Holds subject expertise, bio summaries, ratings, and rates. |
| `bookings` | Booking inquiries | Tracks booking date, time slots, zone settings, meeting type, and status. |
| `contact_messages` | Landing page contact forms | Name, email, subject, text message. |
| `course_categories` | Curriculum groupings | Standard divisions (Math, coding, etc.). |
| `courses` | Subject rosters | Title, descriptions, target tags, banner image URLs. |
| `topics` | Syllabus topics | Parent course mapping (`course_id`), sort order titles. |
| `materials` | Lesson file references | Associated topic (`topic_id`), cloud storage file URLs, file types. |
| `student_courses` | Enrollment directory | Maps students to courses and assigned tutors. |
| `tasks` | Homework or exams definitions | Contains parameters like quiz questions JSON or assignment descriptions. |
| `student_tasks` | Homework submissions | Student answers, file upload links, scores, and tutor feedback. |
| `schedules` | Live classroom events | Link coordinates, scheduled dates, and meeting links. |
| `attendance` | Classroom attendance logs | Linked schedule ID, student status (*Present/Absent/Late*), and notes. |
| `chat_messages` | Platform chat messages | Sender information, text content, and timestamps. |

The root of the directory contains the SQL files for setting up the tables, indexing, and seed data:
- `add_categories_and_booking_fields.sql`: Initializes categories, seeds the primary courses registry, and updates student profile schemas.
- `add_course_image.sql`: Appends the `image_url` column to course references.
- `add_missing_task_columns.sql`: Configures task publishing options and student-specific assignments capability.

## Getting Started & Local Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- NPM package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository and enter the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd learncilacademy
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   To run in production mode with Supabase, create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
   ```
   *If `.env.local` is omitted, the application will automatically start in **Mock Mode** using local storage data.*

4. **Launch the Local Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

5. **Build and Preview Production Bundle**:
   Verify bundle creation before shipping to hosts:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Preview the compiled build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
